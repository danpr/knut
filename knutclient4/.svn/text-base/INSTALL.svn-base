Basic Installation
==================
The simplest way to compile this package is:

  1. `cd' to the directory build.

  2 Type cmake ../. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/ -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release

     Running `cmake' takes a while.  While running, it prints some
     messages telling which features it is checking for.

  3. Type `make' to compile the package.

  4. Type `make install' to install the programs and any data files and
     documentation.
